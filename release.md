# Weasel v0.4.0 Release Messages

## Telegram Group

Hey!

Weasel 0.4.0 is out - big Claude Code update.

Added 9 specialized skills that activate when you say "weasel <command>":

**Audit:**
- `weasel analyze` - security review
- `weasel validate` - attack hypothesis check
- `weasel filter` - false positive triage
- `weasel poc` - writes exploit tests
- `weasel report` - formats audit findings
- `weasel overview` - project scoping

**Dev:**
- `weasel gas` - gas optimization
- `weasel explain` - code explanation
- `weasel simplify` - code refactoring

Skills give Claude domain expertise - it knows how to write Foundry PoCs, format reports, triage false positives.

Install: `weasel plugin install`

Cursor/Windsurf still work via MCP, but Claude Code gets the full skill experience now.

### 1. (hook + video)

What if your AI could actually audit smart contracts?

Not copy-paste to ChatGPT.
Real security workflows, in your IDE.

Just released Weasel 0.4.0 with 9 AI skills for Claude Code 🧵

(native video/gif - under 2:20)

### 2. (show value)

Say "weasel poc" → Claude writes a Foundry exploit test
Say "weasel report" → formats a Code4rena-style finding
Say "weasel validate" → checks if your attack actually works

It knows Solidity security patterns. Not just autocomplete.

### 3. (full list)

All 9 skills:

Audit:
• analyze - security review
• validate - attack check
• filter - triage false positives
• poc - exploit tests
• report - audit findings
• overview - project scoping

Dev:
• gas - optimization
• explain - code walkthrough
• simplify - refactoring

### 4. (CTA + question)

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf.

Install in 10 seconds:
curl -L weasel.sh | bash
weasel plugin install

What security workflows would you want AI to handle?

Built on detectors from my Code4rena bot race days - finally open-sourcing them.

Star ⭐ if useful, more detectors coming.

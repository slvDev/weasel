# Weasel Validate

Expert in validating user's proposed attack vectors and vulnerability hypotheses.

**Context:** This skill validates USER's ideas. For filtering Weasel output, see weasel-filter.

## When to Activate

- User proposes an attack and wants validation
- User asks "is this exploitable?"
- User wants to verify their vulnerability hypothesis
- User found something and wants confirmation

## Validation Process

User proposes an attack vector:
```
User: "I think there's reentrancy here because balance updates after
       the call. Is this actually exploitable?"
```

### Step 1: Understand Hypothesis

Extract from user's description:
- What vulnerability type? (reentrancy, access control, etc.)
- Which contract/function?
- What's the proposed attack flow?
- What impact does user expect?

### Step 2: Read the Code

- Read the referenced function
- Read surrounding context (modifiers, inherited contracts)
- Check related functions that might affect the attack

### Step 3: Trace Attack Path

Walk through the proposed attack step-by-step:
1. How does attacker enter?
2. What state changes occur?
3. Where is the vulnerability triggered?
4. What's the outcome?

### Step 4: Check Preconditions

- Can attacker reach this code path?
- Are required states achievable?
- What permissions are needed?
- Are there timing constraints?

### Step 5: Check Guards

Look for protections user might have missed:
- Reentrancy guards
- Access control modifiers
- Input validation
- State checks

### Step 6: Verdict

- **CONFIRMED** - Attack works as described
- **PARTIAL** - Attack works but with limitations
- **NOT EXPLOITABLE** - Protected or unreachable

## Output Format

```markdown
## Attack Validation

**Hypothesis:** [User's proposed attack]
**Target:** Contract.function()

### Analysis

[Step-by-step trace of the attack path]

**Preconditions checked:**
- [x] Attacker can call function
- [x] Required state is achievable
- [ ] No reentrancy guard present

### Verdict: [CONFIRMED/PARTIAL/NOT EXPLOITABLE]

**Reason:** [Why it works or doesn't]
**Evidence:** [Code references with line numbers]

### Next Steps (if confirmed)
- Severity: [High/Medium/Low]
- Want me to write a PoC?
- Want me to format as report?
```

## Common Attack Patterns to Check

### Reentrancy
- External call before state update?
- No reentrancy guard?
- Callback possible?

### Access Control
- Missing modifier?
- Bypassable check?
- Privilege escalation?

### Flash Loan Attacks
- Price manipulation possible?
- Single-transaction exploit?
- Oracle dependency?

### Front-running
- Transaction ordering matters?
- MEV extractable?
- Commit-reveal missing?

## After Validation

If CONFIRMED:
- Offer to write PoC (→ weasel-poc)
- Offer to format as report (→ weasel-report)
- Suggest severity level

If NOT EXPLOITABLE:
- Explain why it's protected
- Point to the guard/protection
- Suggest what would make it exploitable
